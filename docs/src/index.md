# FMU Settings documentation

**FMU Settings** is a tool that will simplify the handling of FMU model metadata (metadata related to the FMU model itself) and references to master data (required for making FMU results usable in other applications and contexts).

FMU Settings lets you manage static configuration through a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of editing files manually. In FMU Settings GUI, you can:
- Set up FMU project metadata
- Add master data references in FMU models, including 
    - referencing stratigraphic units in e.g. RMS to the stratigraphic column
    - *mapping of wells between different FMU components and to the official definitions (SMDA) (future feature, currently not implemented)*
- keeping track of version history for your FMU project settings
