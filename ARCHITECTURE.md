# Architecture

This page describes the architecture owned by this repository and the high-level relationship between `fmu-settings` and the surrounding FMU Settings repositories.

`fmu-settings` is the behavioral core. It reads, writes, and manages resources in project and user `.fmu/` directories, including locking, diffing, caching, restoring, and validation.

```

The dependency chain is intentionally layered:

- [`fmu-settings`](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-settings) reads, writes, and manages the resources stored in `.fmu/` directories.
- [`fmu-datamodels`](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-datamodels) provides the shared vocabulary for masterdata, access, global configuration, and mappings.
- [`fmu-settings-api`](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-settings-api) wraps `fmu-settings` in a session-oriented application layer, coordinates interaction with external systems, and serves the packaged GUI assets.
- [`fmu-settings-gui`](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-settings-gui) builds and packages the React application, which talks to the API.
- [`fmu-settings-cli`](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-settings-cli) is the user-facing command line interface for bootstrapping user state, launching the combined application, and running utility commands.

The main library split is:

- `FMUDirectoryBase` is the filesystem-centered abstraction. It owns the `.fmu` path, lock manager, cache manager, and generic read/write helpers.
- `ProjectFMUDirectory` and `UserFMUDirectory` specialize the base class for project-local `.fmu/` directories and `$HOME/.fmu/`.
- `PydanticResourceManager` is the generic resource engine for loading, saving, diffing, and caching JSON-backed Pydantic models.
- `MigrationManager` applies registered, forward-only schema migrations and validates the result as the current Pydantic model.
- `MutablePydanticResourceManager` adds dot-notation `get`, `set`, `update`, `reset`, and merge behavior for editable resources.
- `ProjectConfigManager`, `UserConfigManager`, `MappingsManager`, and `LogManager` bind specific Pydantic models to managed files inside `.fmu/`.
- Directory objects compose the correct managers and delegate resource operations to them.

## Schema Migration

`ProjectConfig`, `UserConfig`, and `InternalMappings` are versioned resources. Each
model declares its current schema version, and each resource manager has a
`MigrationManager` with the migration registry for that model.

Migration is forward-only. Data without `schema_version` is treated as version 1.
Each registered migration function increments the schema version by one. The manager
rejects a newer schema, a missing migration step, an invalid version, or data that
does not validate as the current model.

The migration boundary depends on the resource operation:

- **Load:** `PydanticResourceManager` decodes the stored JSON and asks
  `MigrationManager` for a validated current model. Migration happens in memory.
  Loading does not write the resource, create a cache revision, or add a changelog
  entry.
- **Save:** The resource manager checks the write lock first. If the stored data is
  older, it attempts to store the exact original JSON under
  `.fmu/migration-backups/` before writing the current model. This backup is
  best-effort: a file-system failure is logged and does not stop the save. The
  original JSON is also stored as a cache revision. The newly written current
  data is added as another cache revision.
- **Cache read:** `CacheManager` uses the migration manager to return old revisions
  as current validated models.
- **Restore:** `CacheManager` migrates the selected revision before writing it, so
  the restored resource uses the current schema. If you roll back to an older
  release while the pre-migration revision is still retained, restore that revision with
  the older release to return the resource file to the older schema. Project restore
  operations use the existing restore changelog entry.

There is no backward migration. After a current-schema resource is saved, an older
`fmu-settings` release can reject it as newer than supported. If the pre-migration
cache revision is still retained, restore it with the older release. Migration
backups are not loaded or restored by the library. If the cache revision is no longer
available, we should help users copy the appropriate migration backup back to the
resource file before running the older release.

See the
[schema migration guide](src/fmu/settings/_migrations/README.md)
for the implementation, test, and coordinated release process.

## Runtime Flow

The full runtime spans multiple repositories, but `fmu-settings` owns the `.fmu/` directory operations used by the API and CLI.

When a user runs the command `fmu settings`, `fmu-settings-cli` starts a local application around `fmu-settings`:

1. The CLI ensures the user-level `.fmu/` directory exists, creating `$HOME/.fmu/` through `init_user_fmu_directory()` when needed.
2. It creates a short-lived bootstrap token used only to authenticate the browser session startup.
3. It gets the packaged React static directory from `fmu-settings-gui` and starts one FastAPI/Uvicorn process with the static directory, bootstrap token, and runtime settings.
4. It opens the browser on the local application URL with the bootstrap token in the URL fragment.
5. The React app reads the token from the fragment, stores it in browser session storage, and exchanges it for an API session.
6. The API verifies the bootstrap token, ensures user settings are available, creates or renews a server-side session, and sets an HttpOnly session cookie.
7. If the command was launched from inside an initialized FMU project, the API locates the nearest project `.fmu/` directory and tries to acquire its lock.
8. After session setup, the GUI talks to the API with the session cookie, and the API uses `ProjectFMUDirectory` and `UserFMUDirectory` from `fmu-settings` to read and write managed resources.
